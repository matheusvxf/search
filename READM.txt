The is already a jar file to execute the project. To run it:
1) Give executable permission to the jar file
2) Execute the command:

java -jar search.jar

The options of the program are in Portuguese (sorry about it), so a little help:
1- Search word
2- Search phrase
3- Exit

The program get the files from the 'file' directory and feed a data structure that allows quickly retrieve the searched expressions.
The name of the input files should be inserted into the robots.txt.

Have fun!
